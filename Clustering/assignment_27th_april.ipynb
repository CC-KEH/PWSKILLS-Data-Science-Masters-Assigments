    "\n",
    "2. **Scalability:**\n",
    "   - K-means can handle a large number of data points and features.\n",

    "   - Results are easy to interpret, and clusters are well-defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Consistent Results:**\n",
    "   - With the same initial conditions, K-means often converges to the same result, making it reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations of K-means Clustering:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sensitive to Initial Centroid Positions:**\n",
    "   - Results can be sensitive to the initial placement of centroids, leading to different solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assumes Spherical Clusters:**\n",
    "   - K-means assumes that clusters are spherical and equally sized, making it less suitable for elongated or irregularly shaped clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Requires Pre-specification of K:**\n",
    "   - The number of clusters (K) needs to be specified a priori, and an inappropriate choice may lead to suboptimal results.\n",

    "4. **Sensitive to Outliers:**\n",
    "   - Outliers can significantly affect the position of centroids and the resulting clusters.\n",

    "   - Assumes that clusters have similar variances and sizes, which may not always be the case in real-world datasets.\n",
