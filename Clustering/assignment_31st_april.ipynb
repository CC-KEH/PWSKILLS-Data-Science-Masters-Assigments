These measures consider the utility of the language model within the context of a specific application, rather than focusing solely on the intrinsic properties of the model itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Integration with Downstream Applications:** The goal is to assess how well the language model contributes to the success of a downstream application or task. For instance, in sentiment analysis, the extrinsic measure could be the accuracy of sentiment predictions made by the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **End-to-End Performance:** Extrinsic measures provide a holistic evaluation of the language model's effectiveness in addressing real-world challenges. This is crucial because the ultimate purpose of language models in NLP is to enhance the performance of applications that rely on language understanding and generation.\n",
    "\n",
