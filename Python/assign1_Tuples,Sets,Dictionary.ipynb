    "Q1. What are the characteristics of the tuples? Is tuple immutable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Tuples are list like Data Structure but with strict rules.\n",
    "        characteristics of tuples are as follows:\n",
    "        1. Immutable: Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed. This makes tuples ideal for representing values that should not change, such as dates, times, or names.\n",
    "        2. Ordered: The elements in a tuple have a defined order, and that order is maintained when the tuple is accessed.\n",
    "        3. Indexable: Tuples can be indexed just like lists, allowing you to access individual elements.\n",
    "        4. Named Tuples: Named tuples allow you to define a tuple with named elements, making it easier to access the elements of the tuple.\n",
    "        5. Efficient: Tuples are more efficient than lists in terms of memory usage and access time, since they have a fixed size.\n",
    "        6. They can be used as key in dictionaries whereas list cannot."
