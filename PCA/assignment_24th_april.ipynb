    "A projection refers to the transformation of high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional subspace. The primary goal of PCA is to identify a set of orthogonal axes (principal components) in the data space, and the projection involves expressing the original data points in terms of these principal components. Here's how the projection is used in PCA:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Principal Components:**\n",
    "   - PCA identifies principal components, which are linear combinations of the original features. These components are ordered by the amount of variance they capture in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Transformation Matrix:**\n",
    "   - The principal components are organized into a transformation matrix, where each column represents a principal component. The matrix is constructed such that the first column corresponds to the first principal component, the second column to the second principal component, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Projection:**\n",
    "   - To project high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional subspace, the data is multiplied by the transpose of the transformation matrix. This operation effectively projects the data onto the subspace defined by the principal components.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dimensionality Reduction:**\n",
    "   - By selecting a subset of the principal components, one can reduce the dimensionality of the data. The reduced-dimensional representation retains the most significant information in the data, as the principal components are ordered by the amount of variance they capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Interpretation:**\n",
    "   - The resulting projection provides a new coordinate system where the first axis captures the most variance, the second axis captures the second most, and so on. This facilitates the interpretation of data patterns and helps identify the most important directions in the feature space."
