    "Overfitting:\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when a model learns to fit the training data too closely, capturing the noise and specific details of the training examples. As a result, the model becomes overly complex and fails to generalize well to new, unseen data. Some characteristics of overfitting include:\n",

    "High training accuracy: The model performs very well on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low test accuracy: The model's performance on unseen data is significantly worse than on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Excessive complexity: The model may have too many parameters or exhibit complex patterns to accommodate noise in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequences: \n",
    "Poor generalization: The model fails to generalize to new data, making it ineffective for real-world applications.\n",
    "Sensitivity to noise: Overfit models are highly sensitive to small fluctuations or outliers in the data, leading to incorrect predictions.\n",
    "Increased model complexity: Overfitting often results in unnecessarily complex models, which can be computationally expensive and harder to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mitigation:\n",
    "Increase training data: Collecting more training examples can help the model learn generalizable patterns and reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization techniques: Techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization add a penalty term to the model's loss function, discouraging overly complex parameter values.\n",

    "Increase the amount of training data: Having more diverse and representative data helps the model generalize better and reduces overfitting. Collecting additional data or using data augmentation techniques can be beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use regularization techniques: Regularization adds a penalty term to the model's loss function, discouraging complex patterns and reducing overfitting. Two common regularization methods are L1 regularization (Lasso) and L2 regularization (Ridge). They add a constraint to the model's parameters, making them smaller and less prone to overfitting.\n",

    "\n",
    "Perform cross-validation: Cross-validation allows you to evaluate the model's performance on multiple subsets of the data. It helps identify overfitting by assessing the model's generalization ability and can guide parameter tuning or model selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early stopping: Monitor the model's performance on a validation set during training. If the model starts to overfit, the validation loss will begin to increase while the training loss continues to decrease. Stop training when the validation loss starts to deteriorate, preventing further overfitting.\n",

Underfitting is typically characterized by low training and test accuracy. Here are some scenarios where underfitting can occur:\n",
    "\n",

L1 regularization can lead to models with fewer features, as it tends to set less relevant features to zero.\n",

    "Dropout:\n",
    "Dropout is a regularization technique commonly used in neural networks. It randomly drops out (sets to zero) a fraction of the neurons during training. This prevents specific neurons from relying too heavily on each other and encourages the network to learn more robust representations. Dropout acts as an ensemble technique, as multiple subnetworks with different dropped-out neurons are trained simultaneously.\n",

    "Early Stopping:\n",
    "Early stopping is not a direct regularization technique but a method to prevent overfitting. It involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training. If the model's performance on the validation set starts to deteriorate, training is stopped early, preventing further overfitting. The model's weights at the point of early stopping are used as the final model."
