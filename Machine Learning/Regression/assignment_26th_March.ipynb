    "2. **Independence:**\n",
    "   - **Assumption:** The residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) are independent of each other.\n",

    "Multicollinearity is a statistical issue that arises when two or more independent variables in a multiple linear regression model are highly correlated. In other words, it indicates a strong linear relationship between independent variables. This can cause problems in the estimation of the regression coefficients and affect the overall reliability of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issues Associated with Multicollinearity:**\n",

    "1. **Unstable Coefficients:** The coefficients of the correlated variables become unstable, making it difficult to assess the individual contribution of each variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Correlation Matrix:**\n",
    "   - Examine the correlation matrix among the independent variables. High correlation coefficients (close to 1 or -1) indicate potential multicollinearity.\n",

    "2. **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF):**\n",
    "   - VIF measures how much the variance of an estimated regression coefficient increases if the predictors are correlated.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Differences from Linear Regression:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Functional Form:**\n",
    "   - Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables y = b_0 + b_1x.\n",
    "   - Polynomial regression allows for a polynomial relationship of degree n, introducing higher-order terms like x^2, x^3, ..., x^n.\n",

    "   - Linear regression is limited to straight-line relationships.\n",
    "   - Polynomial regression is more flexible and can capture curves and bends in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Complexity:**\n",
    "   - Polynomial regression can capture more complex patterns in the data due to the inclusion of higher-order terms.\n",
    "   - Linear regression is simpler and may not capture nonlinear relationships effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interpretation:**\n",
    "   - In linear regression, the interpretation of coefficients is straightforward. Each coefficient represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable.\n",
    "   - In polynomial regression, the interpretation becomes more complex as it involves the effect of changes in the independent variable and its powers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Overfitting:**\n",
    "   - Polynomial regression has the potential to overfit the data, especially when the degree of the polynomial is high. This means the model may fit the training data too closely and perform poorly on new, unseen data.\n",
    "   - Linear regression is less prone to overfitting, but it may underfit if the relationship is nonlinear.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Improved Fit for Nonlinear Data:**\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Overfitting:**\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Increased Complexity:**\n",
    "   - As the degree of the polynomial increases, the complexity of the model also increases. This can lead to more difficult interpretation and increased computational requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sensitivity to Outliers:**\n",
    "   - Polynomial regression can be sensitive to outliers in the data, and a single outlier can have a significant impact on the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Lack of Extrapolation Accuracy:**\n",
    "   - Polynomial models may not extrapolate well beyond the range of the observed data, leading to inaccurate predictions for values outside the range of the training data.\n",

    "**When to Prefer Polynomial Regression:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nonlinear Relationships:**\n",
    "   - Use polynomial regression when there is evidence of a nonlinear relationship between the independent and dependent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Capturing Curves or Bends:**\n",
    "   - Choose polynomial regression when you want to capture curves, bends, or fluctuations in the data that a linear model cannot represent effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flexible Modeling:**\n",
    "   - When the data exhibit complex patterns that cannot be adequately captured by a linear model, polynomial regression offers greater flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Localized Patterns:**\n",
    "   - In situations where certain regions of the data exhibit different trends or behaviors, polynomial regression with different degrees in different regions (piecewise polynomial regression) may be beneficial.\n",

    "5. **Improving Fit with Limited Data:**\n",
