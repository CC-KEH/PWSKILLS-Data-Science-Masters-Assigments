    "   - The process of creating decision boundaries is recursive. At each internal node, a feature and threshold are chosen to split the data into two subsets. This splitting continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum depth or a minimum number of samples in a leaf node.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. **Class Imbalance:**\n",
    "   - If the dataset is imbalanced (i.e., one class significantly outnumbers the other), accuracy may not be an appropriate metric. Metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, or area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) are often more informative for imbalanced datasets.\n",
