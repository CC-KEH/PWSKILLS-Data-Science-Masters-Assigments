    "AI is a broad field that encompasses the development of intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. It involves simulating human intelligence in machines through techniques such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and expert systems. AI aims to enable machines to perceive, reason, learn, and make decisions autonomously.\n",

ML algorithms learn from examples or patterns in the data to improve their performance over time. It involves the development of algorithms that can automatically learn and improve from experience, without being explicitly programmed for each task.\n",

    "DL is a specialized subfield of ML that focuses on artificial neural networks inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. DL algorithms are designed to learn and extract hierarchical representations or features from large amounts of data. They excel at processing complex and high-dimensional data such as images, audio, and text. DL has been particularly successful in tasks like image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous decision-making.\n",

It involves using statistical analysis, ML, and other methods to analyze and interpret data, derive meaningful patterns, and make data-driven decisions. DS encompasses data collection, data cleaning, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, ML modeling, and communication of findings."
